# It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.
# The disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

# The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
#
# 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
# 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack
# 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
#
# New line
# Test2
#The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
